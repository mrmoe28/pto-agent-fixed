# Fix Summary: Permit Office Search Issue

## Problem
Users were seeing "Permit office data is being collected. Check back shortly." instead of actual permit office results when searching for locations like Lawrenceville, GA.

## Root Causes
1. **Empty Database**: No permit office data existed in the database for Georgia locations
2. **No Background Job Processor**: Scrape jobs were queued but never processed
3. **Poor UX**: Error messages didn't explain what was happening or provide next steps

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Database Seeding ✅
**File**: `database/seeds/georgia-permit-offices.sql`
- Added seed data for 11 major Georgia permit offices
- Includes: Lawrenceville, Gwinnett County, Atlanta, Fulton County, Marietta, Cobb County, Alpharetta, Roswell, Sandy Springs, Decatur, and DeKalb County
- Each office includes:
  - Contact information (phone, email, website)
  - Operating hours
  - Services offered (building, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, zoning permits)
  - Online portal URLs
  - Geographic coordinates

**How to use**:
```bash
psql -h $PGHOST -U $PGUSER -d $PGDATABASE -f database/seeds/georgia-permit-offices.sql
```

### 2. Background Job Processor ✅
**File**: `src/app/api/jobs/process/route.ts`
- Processes pending scrape jobs from the database
- Fetches permit office data via web search
- Inserts results into database
- Can be triggered by:
  - Vercel Cron (every 5 minutes)
  - Manual API call
  - External cron service

**API Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/jobs/process` - Process pending jobs
- `GET /api/jobs/process` - Check job status

### 3. Web Scraping Implementation ✅
**File**: `src/lib/permit-scraper.ts`
- Uses Google Custom Search API to find permit office websites
- Extracts basic information from search results
- Stores data in database with 'web_search' source
- Includes basic instruction extraction

### 4. Improved Error Handling ✅
**File**: `src/components/Hero.tsx`
- Shows amber "info" box instead of red "error" for data collection
- Displays loading spinner
- Provides "Click to refresh" button
- Explains that data collection takes 1-2 minutes

### 5. Vercel Cron Configuration ✅
**File**: `vercel.json`
- Added cron job to run every 5 minutes
- Automatically processes pending scrape jobs
- Ensures background jobs are executed regularly

## Testing Results
✅ API now returns Lawrenceville permit offices immediately
✅ Database contains 11 seeded Georgia locations
✅ Background job processor functional
✅ UI provides better user feedback

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

### 1. Enhanced Web Scraping
- Implement actual page scraping (not just search results)
- Extract detailed information:
  - Permit fees
  - Processing times
  - Required documents
  - Application instructions
  - Downloadable forms

### 2. Expand Coverage
- Add seed data for more states
- Implement state-specific scraping strategies
- Build scrapers for common permit office platforms (Accela, Viewpoint, etc.)

### 3. Job Monitoring
- Add admin dashboard to monitor scrape jobs
- Show job status and errors
- Retry failed jobs automatically
- Alert when jobs are stuck

### 4. Data Quality
- Verify and update existing data regularly
- Flag outdated information
- Add data confidence scores
- Allow users to report incorrect data

### 5. Performance
- Cache search results more aggressively
- Preemptively scrape popular locations
- Add CDN for static office data

## Environment Variables Required
```env
# Required for web scraping
GOOGLE_CUSTOM_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_key_here
GOOGLE_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=your_id_here

# Optional for cron authentication
CRON_SECRET=your_secret_here

# Database (already configured)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
```

## Deployment Checklist
- [x] Seed database with Georgia permit offices
- [x] Deploy updated code to Vercel
- [x] Verify cron job is enabled in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Set CRON_SECRET environment variable (optional)
- [ ] Monitor first few cron executions
- [ ] Test search functionality in production

## Manual Job Processing
If cron isn't working, you can manually trigger job processing:

```bash
# With authentication
curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/jobs/process \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET"

# Without authentication (if CRON_SECRET not set)
curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/jobs/process
```

## Support & Maintenance
- Monitor Vercel cron logs for errors
- Check database for failed jobs: `SELECT * FROM scrape_jobs WHERE status = 'failed'`
- Review and update seed data quarterly
- Respond to user reports of incorrect data
